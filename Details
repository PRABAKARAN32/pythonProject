About:

    The core idea is to give an input as mobile_number and and get the output as country_code , service_provider_name
    ,Latitude and Long , and at last the saved html file with the location of the mobile number with marker
    in map.

Procedure(Algoritham):

   Step1: Open a pythonfile NumberLocation.py and MyNumber.py.
   Step2: Get the Mobile_number in Mynumber.py file.
   Step3: import the packages i.e phonenumbers , folium , and import Mobile_Number from Mynumber.py as number.
   Step4: To know the Country location Name import geocoder from phonenumbers.
   Step5: yournumber = phonenumbers.parse(number) //.parse is used for storing validating international phone numbers.
   Step6: yourlocation = geocoder.description_for_number(yournumber,"en") // .description_for_number is used to store the country Name.
   Step7: Print(yourlocation)

   To Know the Local Service Provider name.

   Step8: from phonenumbers import carrier // to know the service provider name.
   Step9: service_provider_name = carrier.name_for_number(yournumber,"en") // storing the service provider name.
   Step10: print the service provider name.

   To Know the Location.

   Step11: from opencage.geocoder import OpenCageGeocode // pip install opencage
   Step12: goto https://opencagedata.com website and copy the API_KEY used to know
           the location of the number.
   Step13: key = "key_name"
   Step14: geocoder = OpenCageGeocode(key) // used to store the http file formate.
   Step15: quary = str(yourlocation) // storing the location in quary variable in string formate.
   Step16: result = geocoder.geocode(quary) // storing the result in result variable.
   Step17: lat = result[0]['geometry']['lat']lng = result[0]['geometry']['lng']
           // Since we need the Latitude and Longitude we access through indexing.
   Step18: print(lat,lng) // To print the Latitude and Longitude.
   Step19: myMap = folium.Map(location=[lat, lng],zoom_start=9) // used to identify the location in map and
           Zoom it untill 9x.
   Step20: folium.Marker([lat,lng],popup=yourlocation).add_to(myMap) // used to show the popup in map.

   To store all the above information in HTML formate.

   Step21: myMap.save("myLocation.html") // to stor in html formate.
   Step22: open the HTML file in any Browser to know the location.
